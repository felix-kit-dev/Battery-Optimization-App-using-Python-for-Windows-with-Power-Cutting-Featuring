# Battery-Optimization-App-using-Python-for-Windows-with-Power-Cutting-Feature
Creating a battery optimization app for Windows 10 and Windows 11 involves several steps. The app will use the Windows Power Management API and other system APIs to monitor the battery status, display notifications, and manage power settings.

Here's a simplified example using Python with tkinter for the GUI and ctypes for accessing system APIs. This example will show the basic structure and functionality:

Install necessary libraries:

pip install pywin32
Create the main application:

Explanation:
Battery Status Check:

The get_battery_status method uses the Windows API to get the current battery status.
GUI Components:

tkinter is used to create the GUI with labels and checkbuttons.
Notifications:

win32api is used to display message boxes for notifications. This can be extended to use Windows Toast notifications for a more integrated experience.
Power Management:

The cut_power method is a placeholder and simulates power cutting. Actual implementation would require hardware and driver-specific commands.
Periodic Updates:

The battery status is updated every 60 seconds using self.root.after.
This code provides a basic structure for a battery optimization app. Depending on hardware and driver support, the power-cutting functionality might require 
more sophisticated methods or even administrative privileges. For production use, especially for critical operations like cutting power, ensure thorough testing 
and possibly integrate with hardware-specific SDKs.
